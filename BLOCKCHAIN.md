# 1 - Transaction Creation:

Users initiate transactions, which are then broadcast to the network.
Each transaction typically includes the sender's address, the recipient's address, the amount, a timestamp, and other relevant data.
The sender digitally signs the transaction using their private key.

# 2 - Transaction Verification:
Network nodes (often called "full nodes") receive and validate the transactions. They check for things like:
Whether the digital signature is valid.
Whether the sender has enough balance to cover the transaction.
Valid transactions are placed into the node's local memory pool (mempool).

# 3 - Block Creation (Mining):

Miners select transactions from their mempool to form a new block. There's a block size limit, so miners often prioritize transactions that offer higher fees.
Along with transactions, the new block contains:
The hash of the previous block (linking it to the chain).
A timestamp.
A nonce (a random number used in the proof-of-work process).
The miner then begins the process of finding a valid proof-of-work.

# 4 - Proof-of-Work (in blockchains like Bitcoin):

The miner tries to find a value (by varying the nonce) that, when hashed with the contents of the block, produces a hash that meets specific criteria (e.g., a certain number of leading zeros).
This process requires a lot of computational power and energy, hence called "proof-of-work."
Once the miner finds a nonce that produces a valid hash, the proof-of-work is complete.

# 5 - Block Broadcasting:

The miner broadcasts the new block to the network.
Other nodes validate the block by:
Checking its proof-of-work.
Verifying all transactions in the block.
If the block is valid, nodes add it to their local copy of the blockchain and remove the block's transactions from their mempool.

# 6 - Block Addition:

Once the majority of nodes in the network agree on the validity of the block (through the consensus mechanism), the block is added to the blockchain.
The miner who successfully added the block is rewarded with newly minted cryptocurrency (block reward) and transaction fees from the transactions in the block.

# 7 - Continuation:

The process starts again, with the next block being linked to the hash of the block just added.
